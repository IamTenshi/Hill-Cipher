# Hill Cipher Implementation

This Python project implements the Hill Cipher encryption and decryption algorithm. The Hill Cipher is a polygraphic substitution cipher based on linear algebra, designed to encrypt and decrypt messages by using matrices.

## Overview

The project consists of two main files:

- `hill.py`: Contains the implementation of the Hill Cipher algorithm, including functions for encryption, decryption, and key handling.
- `main.py`: A demonstration script that showcases the usage of the Hill Cipher implementation with different keys and plaintexts.

## Usage

To run the demonstration script, use the following command:

```bash
$ python main.py
